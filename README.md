# SaveAnimals
Petition to save endangered species and other animals from predatory humans

Humans are responsible for the extinction of 35% of the world's species, due to neglect, destruction of habitat, and unchecked predation, for food, and sometimes just for sport. Many hunting and culling practices involve torture and agonizing death for the animal, such as steel traps and flaying or burning alive. This petition calls for an end to these barbaric practices. We need to assume our role as caretakers of the planet, and respect the right of other creatures to thrive and coexist with us.
